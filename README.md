# CS-210
1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This is a product tracking program. Used to track what items and how many were sold. It allows printing a list of items and the amounts, searching for the amount sold of a single item, and the creation of a text based histogram for visual representation of products sold.

2. What did you do particularly well?
I feel like the inline comments that I added to the code are clear and easy to follow. Allowing the reader to understand why each block of code exsists and its function.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
The block comments for function are lacking. My inline comments are clear and consise. Without block commets for functions explaining the function and parameters there could be some confusion. This mnakes the code slightly less portable and more difficult to use.

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most difficult part of writing this code for me was the CMAKE file. This is the first time I have worked with CMAKE. I had to watch a few Youtube videos and read the documentation to make sure I was including everything in the CMAKE file that was need to make the program function properly on both Mac and Windows.

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project was the second time I embedded python into C++. I beleive this skill in combining languages can transfer to other personal projects or course work in future classes.

6. How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To keep this project maintainable and adaptable I created functions for each task. I coded minamally in main() to avoid having to change large amounts of code for small changes that make occur. To help with readablility I made in line comments and seperated my C++ and python code into their own files to keep confusing to a minimum.
